Postmortem Report: The Great Traffic Jam of 2024
Issue Summary:
Duration:
The “Great Traffic Jam” took place on August 14, 2024, from 11:45 AM to 1:15 PM (UTC), lasting for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Unfortunately, it wasn’t rush hour on the highway but on our servers!
Impact:
During this time, our e-commerce platform was slower than a snail on a treadmill. Around 70% of our users experienced slow page loads, error messages, and outright failures when trying to make purchases. Imagine the frustration of being just one click away from that perfect deal, only to be greeted by an error message! Sales plummeted by 30%, and we’re pretty sure a few monitors got punched.
Root Cause:
The culprit? A load balancer with a bad sense of direction! It decided to send 80% of the traffic to one unlucky server, while the others were chilling with almost nothing to do. It’s like having a 4-lane highway and cramming all the cars into one lane. Chaos ensued.
Timeline:
11:45 AM: Monitoring alerts start blaring—error rates and response times spike. Panic begins.
11:47 AM: On-call engineer, coffee in hand, jumps into action. Time to figure out who tripped over the server cable.
12:00 PM: Initial theory: The database has gone on strike! Quick call to the DBAs, but all is calm on their end.
12:10 PM: The database team reassures us that it’s not their fault, and the finger-pointing begins.
12:25 PM: Someone finally checks traffic patterns. Ding, ding, ding! We’ve got one server drowning in requests while the others are on a coffee break.
12:30 PM: Time to call in the network team, aka the traffic controllers.
12:45 PM: Network team traces the issue to a recent change in the load balancer’s configuration. Classic case of “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
12:55 PM: The offending configuration is rolled back. Crisis narrowly avoided.
1:10 PM: Monitoring gives the all-clear, and we can finally exhale.
1:15 PM: The system is fully back online. Time to celebrate with a sigh of relief (and maybe another cup of coffee).
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:
A well-intentioned but poorly executed load balancer reconfiguration led to one server being buried under 80% of the traffic. The other servers were practically twiddling their thumbs. The result? Slowdowns, errors, and a lot of unhappy customers.
Resolution:
We rolled back the load balancer configuration to its previous, balanced state. The network team gave the load balancer a stern talking-to, ensuring it wouldn’t play favorites with traffic again.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements:
Load Balancer Configuration Validation: Implement automated checks to ensure no rogue configurations slip through again.
Enhanced Monitoring: Set up alerts to detect if one server is hogging all the traffic, so we can catch this faster than you can say “traffic jam.”
Load Testing: Schedule regular load tests to simulate these scenarios and avoid future bottlenecks.
Documentation and Training: Update the documentation with a big, bold “DON’T MESS THIS UP!” warning for the load balancer settings.
Tasks:
Create automated validation rules for load balancer configs.
Add traffic distribution metrics to our monitoring toolkit.
Plan quarterly load tests that simulate peak traffic scenarios.
Revise the load balancer configuration guide and include a training session for the team.
Let’s hope this is the last traffic jam we have to deal with—at least in the data center!
